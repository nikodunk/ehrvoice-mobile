editor's note: Unfortunately, there's no cleaner way to do this (see "upgrading to newest react-native version"): To upgrade to newest version of react-native, simply create a new react native app (ie. react-native init example), replace the package.json of this repository with the new example one, then do

	npm install --save react-native-animatable react-native-button react-native-fontawesome react-native-html-to-pdf react-native-iap react-native-mixpanel react-native-sound react-native-voice react-navigation

# Node Express Minimal email server 0.1

soapdictate uses this server to store the emails – a barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).


### Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.


	$ npm install
	$ npm start


Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/), however you'll need PostgreSQL set up locally to run it 


### Deploying email server to Heroku

	
	git add server_node_express
	git commit -m "improved email server"
	git push heroku `git subtree split --prefix server_node_express master`:master --force

# Hugo generator for mimimal web presence (static landing page) at soapdictate.com

to deploy to github pages, simply run "hugo" command to build to "docs" folder and deploy.

	cd landingpage_hugo
	hugo

This generates a "docs" folder with static website in it – move this to root of repo for publishing to Github pages or another service.
	
	mv docs ..
	cd ..
	git add docs/
	git commit -m "new content update"
	git push origin master


If shit's broken after npm install in RN 57.7, just run 

	cd ./node_modules/react-native && scripts/ios-install-third-party.sh && cd third-party && cd $(ls | grep 'glog' | awk '{print $1}') && ./configure
